## How to get Gemini up and running

To start you need to create a .env file in the backend directory. To do this please navigate to the backend directory and use the following command:

```touch .env```

Next make your way [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to get a Gemini API key. Once you've got your key paste the following into your .env file: 

APIKEY = Whatever_Your_API_Key_Is

Once thats all set up gemini should be good to go! :)
