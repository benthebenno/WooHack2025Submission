## Our App hopes to solve the issues of transparency and safety of the aviation industry

The app delivers translated information directly to users, providing them with clear, real-time updates about their flight, including safety status, delays, and any critical incidents.

## How to get SkyWatch up and running

To start you need to create a .env file in the backend directory. To do this please navigate to the backend directory and use the following command:

```touch .env```

Next make your way [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to get a Gemini API key. Once you've got your key paste the following into your .env file: 

APIKEY = Whatever_Your_API_Key_Is

Once thats all set up gemini should be good to go! :)

## Future 

In the future we hope SkyWatch will hopefully transform the aviation industry into a safer more transparent place. We hope to achieve this goal by enabling passengers to report safety concerns and incidents to create a community-driven safety network and expanding SkyWatch to work internationally, translating ATC communications across different languages and flight regions.
